When light hits the boundary between the core and the cladding at a specific angle, it reflects completely.\n\\[\\theta_c = \\arcsin \\left( \\frac{n_2}{n_1} \\right)\\]\nAs long as the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle \\(\\theta_c\\), the light stays trapped inside the fiber."
