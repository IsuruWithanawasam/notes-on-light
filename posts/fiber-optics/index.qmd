### Total Internal Reflection
Fiber optics work because of a principle called **Total Internal Reflection**. When light hits the boundary between the core and the cladding at a specific angle, it reflects completely.

$$\theta_c = \arcsin \left( \frac{n_2}{n_1} \right)$$

As long as the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle $\theta_c$, the light stays trapped inside the fiber.
