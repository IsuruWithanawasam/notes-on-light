### Introduction
Fiber optics rely on the principle of **Total Internal Reflection**. When light hits a boundary at an angle larger than the critical angle, it reflects back entirely into the medium.

$$\theta_c = \arcsin\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)$$

### Why it Matters
This allows data to travel thousands of miles with minimal signal loss.
